Timestamp Display Feature
=========================

OVERVIEW
--------
Data points on elevation profiles now show timestamps in HH:MM format!

This helps you understand:
- When you reached specific points on your route
- How long segments took
- Where you stopped or slowed down
- Time of day at different elevations


HOW IT WORKS
------------

Automatic Display:
- Timestamps appear next to data points on the plot
- Format: HH:MM (24-hour format in your local timezone)
- Smart spacing: Shows up to 20 timestamps to avoid overcrowding
- First point: Green dot (start of journey)
- Last point: Red dot (end of journey)
- Other points: Blue dots with timestamps

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS
-----------------

Scenario 1: Morning Hike
    Start: 08:30
    Points: 08:45, 09:00, 09:15, 09:30
    End: 09:45
    
    You can see:
    - Entire hike took 1 hour 15 minutes
    - Regular 15-minute intervals between points
    - Steady progress

Scenario 2: Lunch Break Visible
    Points: 11:00, 11:15, 11:30 ... [gap] ... 13:00, 13:15
    
    You can see:
    - Time gap indicates a stop (lunch break)
    - Different pace before/after break

Scenario 3: Summit Push
    Points: 09:00, 09:20, 09:45, 10:15, 10:50
    
    You can see:
    - Increasing time between points
    - Slowing down as altitude increases
    - Last segment took 35 minutes (steepest)


TIMESTAMP SOURCES
-----------------

GPX files contain timestamps in two formats:

1. Standard GPX:
   <trkpt lat="45.5000" lon="-122.6750">
     <ele>100.0</ele>
     <time>2024-01-15T10:30:00Z</time>  ← Timestamp
   </trkpt>

2. If your GPX file has timestamps, they appear on the plot
3. If no timestamps: plot shows without times (elevation only)


BENEFITS
--------

✓ See your pace throughout the journey
✓ Identify rest stops or delays
✓ Understand time vs. distance relationship
✓ Plan future trips based on timing
✓ Verify GPS recording intervals


SMART SPACING
-------------

The application automatically adjusts how many timestamps to show:

Few Points (< 20):
    Shows timestamp at every point
    
Many Points (> 20):
    Shows ~20 evenly spaced timestamps
    Always includes start and end
    
Why?
    - Prevents text overlap
    - Keeps plot readable
    - Highlights key moments


EXAMPLE USE CASES
-----------------

Use Case 1: Training Analysis
    "I see I'm consistently slower after 2 hours"
    → Timestamps show your pace decline
    
Use Case 2: Trip Planning
    "This segment took 45 minutes last time"
    → Use timestamps to plan your next trip
    
Use Case 3: Group Coordination
    "We reached the viewpoint at 11:30"
    → Share plot to show timing to others
    
Use Case 4: Photography Timing
    "The best light was around 16:30"
    → Timestamps help you remember golden hour


TIMESTAMP FORMAT
----------------

Format: HH:MM (24-hour clock)
Examples:
    08:30 = 8:30 AM
    14:45 = 2:45 PM
    23:15 = 11:15 PM

Timezone: Your local timezone
    - Automatically converted from GPS UTC time
    - Displays in your system's timezone


COLOR CODING
------------

• Green dot = Start of journey
• Blue dots = Regular data points
• Red dot = End of journey

This makes it easy to see at a glance:
- Where you started
- Key points along the way
- Where you finished


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

- Font: 9pt Arial (small, readable)
- Background: Semi-transparent white for readability
- Smart positioning: Above point, or below if near top
- Max display: 20 timestamps (prevents clutter)
- Interval calculation: Automatically spaced


NOTES
-----

1. If your GPX file doesn't have timestamps:
   - You'll still see the elevation profile
   - No time labels will appear
   - Distance markers still show

2. Timestamps reflect GPS recording time:
   - Not when you uploaded the file
   - But when you actually hiked/biked/ran

3. Timezone conversion is automatic:
   - GPS records in UTC
   - Display shows your local time
   - No manual conversion needed!
