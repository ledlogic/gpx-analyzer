Understanding the Distance Calculation
=======================================

This program plots CUMULATIVE PATH DISTANCE (s-distance), not straight-line distance.

Example Scenario:
----------------

Imagine hiking from point A to B to C:

    Start (A)
      |
      | 3km north
      |
      v
    Point B
      |
      | 4km east
      |
      v-----> Point C (End)


Two Different Distance Measurements:
------------------------------------

1. STRAIGHT-LINE DISTANCE (NOT used):
   A → C directly = √(3² + 4²) = 5 km
   
   This would show you're 5km from start, but ignores the path taken.

2. CUMULATIVE PATH DISTANCE (WHAT WE USE - s-distance):
   A → B → C along path = 3km + 4km = 7 km
   
   This shows the actual distance traveled following the route.


What the Graph Shows:
---------------------

X-axis: Cumulative distance traveled along the path (0, 1km, 2km, 3km, 4km, 5km, 6km, 7km)
Y-axis: Altitude at each point

The graph follows your ACTUAL JOURNEY, not your displacement from start.


Real-World Example:
------------------

If you:
1. Hike 5km up a mountain (going north)
2. Hike 5km back down to your starting point (going south)

Straight-line distance from start: 0 km (you're back where you started)
Cumulative path distance: 10 km (the actual distance you hiked)

Our graph will show 10km on the X-axis, showing your complete journey!


Chronological Order:
-------------------

Points are plotted in the order they were recorded (by timestamp if available),
so the graph shows your elevation profile as you traveled along the route over time.

Time --> [Point 1] --> [Point 2] --> [Point 3] --> ... --> [Point N]
         0 km         dist(1→2)     dist(1→2→3)         total distance
